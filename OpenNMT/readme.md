## Info

Here you find some old code for trying to make our dataset / problem work with OpenNMT (open neural machine translation).
The idea here was to treat relation extraction as a translation task, where the input is a sentence,
and the result is the noun phrase part of the sentence that refers to the target named entity (location).
But it didn't work properly.

## Why we keep it for now? 

Maybe new ideas will pop up on how to make this into a OpenNMT task successfully.
